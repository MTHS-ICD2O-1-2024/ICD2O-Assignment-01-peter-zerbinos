      <h3>History</h3>
      <div class="page-content">
        John Edward Hopcroft, born in Seattle, Washington, is a renowned theoretical computer scientist.<br />
        He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Seattle University in 1961 and later obtained his
        master's and Ph.D. from Stanford University.<br />
        Hopcroft worked at Princeton University before joining Cornell University, where he became a professor
        emeritus.<br />
        His textbooks on algorithms and formal languages, co-authored with Jeffrey Ullman and Alfred Aho, are considered
        classics in computer science.<br />
        In 1986, he was awarded the prestigious Turing Award for his contributions to algorithms and data
        structures.<br />
        He has also been recognized with honors such as the IEEE John von Neumann Medal and the Karl V. Karlstrom
        Outstanding Educator Award.
